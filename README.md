# JFSD-project---Service-Booking
This is a JFSD based Service booking application 

The project involves developing a service booking application for computer hardware issues. The application allows customers to report issues, book appointments, 
and track the status of services, while service engineers can manage their assigned tasks. The system also includes functionalities for administrators to oversee the entire process,
manage users, and handle change requests.

The outcome of this project is a robust, web-based service booking application built using the Java Full Stack Development approach. 
It effectively enables customers to report hardware issues, book service appointments, and track service status, while providing service engineers with task management tools. 
The application ensures secure data handling, real-time notifications, and streamlined operations for all users, creating a seamless and efficient service experience.
